/**
Terminologies used in Trees

        Root – The top node in a tree.
        Child – A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
        Parent – The converse notion of a child.
        Siblings – Nodes with the same parent.
        Descendant – A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child.
        Ancestor – A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.
        Leaf – A node with no children.
        Internal node – A node with at least one child
        External node – A node with no children.
        Degree – Number of sub trees of a node.
        Edge – Connection between one node to another.
        Path – A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
        Level – The level of a node is defined by 1 + (the number of connections between the node and the root).
        Height of node – The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between that node and a leaf.
        Height of tree – The height of a tree is the height of its root node.
        Depth – The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.
        Forest – A forest is a set of n ≥ 0 disjoint trees.
